## Concept: What a Batch Is

During training, instead of computing the gradient over the entire dataset at once (too slow) or one sample at a time (too noisy), we use a **mini-batch** — a random subset of samples.

```
Full dataset: 1600 training samples

batch_size=32  →  50 batches per epoch  →  50 gradient updates per epoch
batch_size=256 →  6.25 batches per epoch → ~6 gradient updates per epoch
batch_size=1600 → 1 batch per epoch    →  1 gradient update per epoch (= "full batch")
```

Each gradient update uses only the samples in that batch to compute the gradient. Smaller batches = noisier gradient estimates.

```
One epoch with batch_size=32 (1600 samples):

┌────────┬────────┬────────┬─── ... ───┬────────┐
│batch 1 │batch 2 │batch 3 │           │batch 50│
│ 32     │ 32     │ 32     │   ...     │ 32     │
│samples │samples │samples │           │samples │
└───┬────┴───┬────┴───┬────┘           └───┬────┘
    ▼        ▼        ▼                    ▼
 update   update   update    ...        update
   #1       #2       #3                   #50

 = 50 weight updates per epoch (noisy but frequent)

One epoch with batch_size=1600 (full batch):

┌────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│              all 1600 samples                  │
└────────────────────────┬───────────────────────┘
                         ▼
                      update #1

 = 1 weight update per epoch (stable but infrequent)
```

## Concept: The Noise-Stability Tradeoff

| Batch size | Gradient quality | Updates per epoch | Generalisation | GPU memory |
|------------|-----------------|-------------------|----------------|------------|
| Small (8–32) | Noisy (high variance) | Many | Often better | Low |
| Medium (64–256) | Balanced | Moderate | Good | Moderate |
| Large (512–2048) | Stable (low variance) | Few | Sometimes worse | High |
| Full batch | Very stable | 1 | Can overfit sharper minima | Very high |

The noise from small batches acts as implicit **regularisation** — it prevents the model from settling into sharp, narrow minima that don't generalise. This is counter-intuitive but well-established empirically.

## Concept: The Sharp vs Flat Minima Insight

Research (Keskar et al., 2017) found that large-batch training tends to converge to **sharp minima** — points where the loss is low but the surrounding loss landscape is steep. Small perturbations (new test data) push the model off the cliff.

Small-batch training converges to **flat minima** — the model stays near a low-loss region even under perturbation, which is exactly what generalisation requires.

```
Sharp minimum (large batch):      Flat minimum (small batch):
      |    |                              ___________
      |  * |     ← deep but narrow       |         |
______|    |______                  _____|    *    |_____
                                              ↑ stays low even with perturbation
```

## Concept: Timing Training in Python

```python
import time
start = time.time()
model.fit(...)
elapsed = time.time() - start
print(f"Training time: {elapsed:.1f}s")
```

Use this to compare wall-clock time across batch sizes. Larger batches are often faster per epoch because modern hardware (GPUs especially) are optimised for large matrix operations.

## What Each Task Asks You to Do

### Task 1 — Small batch: batch_size=32
Train for 30 epochs with batch_size=32. Record val_accuracy and wall-clock time.

### Task 2 — Large batch: batch_size=512
Train for 30 epochs with batch_size=512. Compare accuracy and time.

### Task 3 — Full batch: batch_size=1600
Use the full training set as one batch. Observe: does it generalise as well? Is it faster or slower?

### Task 4 — Summary table (Bonus)
Print a formatted comparison table:
```
batch_size | val_accuracy | train_time(s) | updates/epoch
```

## Common Mistakes

**All three give the same accuracy**
This can happen with simple problems — the dataset is easy enough that any batch size works. Try increasing epochs to 100 to see divergence in final accuracy.

**batch_size=1600 gives an error**
Your training set may not be exactly 1600. Use `len(X_train)` instead of a hardcoded number.

**Training time looks backwards (small batch faster)**
On CPU, very small batches have overhead per update. On GPU the relationship is more pronounced. Your machine may show different ratios — focus on the accuracy comparison, not the timing.
